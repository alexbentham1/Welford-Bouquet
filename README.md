This was a test set by a company I had applied to work for - and as such all content belongs to them, I do not own any of the photos etc.
The brief was to take a given screenshot of a webpage, and make it dynamic. To do this I used Bootstrap - this is what you will see in the code files. It is fully responsive to LG/MD/SM/XS screen sizes.
